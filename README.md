# prometheus-examples
This repository contains examples of using prometheus-client for collecting and exporting application metrics. These examples demonstrate how to apply Prometheus metric collectors for metric collection without using frameworks (e.g., Spring).

# Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in your IDE.
3. Run the code from your IDE.
4. Open localhost:8080 in your browser and observe the metrics.

This repository is currently under development, and the architecture of the examples will be improved in the future. Additionally, more scenarios for metric collection and export will be added.
